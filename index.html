                Technology is undergoing rapid advancements, and the emergence of quantum computing represents a major breakthrough. This new Technology, leveraging the unique principles of quantum mechanics, holds the potential to significantly expand processing capabilities. Machine learning, a key component of artificial intelligence, will be one of the first areas to benefit from quantum computing because of the large amount of data involved in machine learning algorithms. "There are potentially promising applications of QML [Quantum Machine Learning] that use optimization to solve problems. Perhaps one of the most famous of these problems is the 'traveling salesman' problem. Here, quantum computing will aid in finding solutions by being able to consider many paths at once, as opposed to the serial method which makes such problems intractable for classical computers."(IonQ Staff, 2023)
                Quantum computing will be able to process this data much faster than classical computers. Quantum computing works by using qubits, which are quantum bits that can be in a superposition of states which means that compared to classical computers which can only be in 2 states 0 or 1, quantum computers can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows quantum computers to process data in parallel, which is much faster than classical computers that process data sequentially. Assuming we can achieve consistent quantum advantage (meaning the state where quantum computers are faster than classic computers) quantum computing will be able to process data much faster than classical computers, which will allow machine learning algorithms to be more accurate and efficient.
                
                "The excitement is undoubtedly caused at least partly by several experimental demonstrations in recent years that have provided evidence of a quantum computational advantage in specific tasks — examples in which classical computers would be able to complete the same task only in a substantially, impractically longer time." ("Seeking a Quantum Advantage for Machine Learning," 2023)

                because of the fact qbits can be in a superposition of states, neural networks which resemble the human brain with nodes that are either 1 (on) or 0 (off) can be trained much faster than what classical computers can do. This is because the nodes in a neural network are connected to each other and the connections between the nodes are assigned weights. These weights are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error between the actual output and the expected output.For example, if we wanted to train a neural network to park a car within 20 seconds, giving it three commands—turn left, turn right, and drive forward—and the parking spot is left and forward, then the neural network would choose between these commands. At the end of the 20 seconds, its choices would be weighted based on how close it got to the parking spot. If it turned the car right, then it would receive the lowest weight. Therefore, in it's next attempts, it would be more likely to choose to drive forward or left, since the 'turn right' command would have a lower weight. This process is called incentive-based learning in neural networks. However, it is computationally intensive, and quantum computers could perform these tasks much faster than classical computers.

                "a quantum advantage for generative modeling may be achieved when ground states, equilibrium states or quantum dynamics can be generated using models incorporating QNNs [Quantum Neural Networks], in a situation where the distribution cannot be sampled classically, and yields more accurate predictions or more extensive generalization compared with classical ML approaches."(Cerezo et al., 2022)

                I think the next step for my research is to learn more about quantum computing and machine learning and how they could work together. I also want to learn more about the applications of quantum machine learning and how they can be used to solve real world problems. I've seen some examples during my research like using it to help with quantum chemistry but im not sure what that entails. also learning how the actual hardware for a quantum computer would be interesting like the wafer in the top picture it looks similar to a classic cpu wafer so i wonder what the physical differences are between them.
